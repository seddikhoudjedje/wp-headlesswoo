# Ionic App With Headless Woocommerce Store

### What was the plan:

The plan was leaning the ins and outs of whatâ€™s possible with the woocommerce REST API ans see what can be build using some kind of headless woocommerce.


### What di I have to do:

Had to quickly deploy an e-commerce store using wordpress and woocommerce and expose an API to be consumed by an Ionic PWA.


### What was the cool part:

What was cool was scraping the products from a random webshop and parsing the data into a properly structured csv that would be understandable by the standard woocommerce product importer.
